# 💫 About Me:
As Full-stack engineer with focus on Python/Node.js backend and modern front-end (React) with over 5 years of hands-on experience, I am proficient in designing, developing, and maintaining dynamic, responsive, and user-centric web applications. I have delivered Python, Node.js backend work and scaling REST/GraphQL APIs, integrating databases and data pipelines for large datasets, implementing automated testing and CI/CD, and deploying secure, cloud-hosted services—while partnering closely with React teams to ship end-to-end features. I am highly skilled in modern front-end technologies such as React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3, with strong expertise in state management libraries including Redux, Context API, and React Query, as well as integrating RESTful APIs and GraphQL for efficient data handling. I am confident in optimizing performance through lazy loading, memoization, and code splitting, ensuring fast and seamless user experiences. I am passionate about accessibility and responsive design, with a deep understanding of WCAG standards and mobile-first development principles. I am adept at writing clean, maintainable, and testable code, with practical knowledge of unit, integration, and end-to-end testing using tools like Cypress. I am familiar with modern build tools and CI/CD workflows such as Webpack, Babel, and Vite, and I actively mentor junior developers, conduct code reviews, and foster a culture of collaboration and innovation within Agile and Scrum environments. Comfortable partnering with Java and React teams; quick to learn adjacent stacks as needed.
